# Tic_Tac_Toe_Project
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with two players using a 3x3 board and placing 'X' or 'O' to create a straight line. In C, it employs a 2D array and routines for move, display, and win, to check valid moves. The ability to include features such as AI, undo, or graphics enhances the gameplay experience, and is an excellent programming project.
