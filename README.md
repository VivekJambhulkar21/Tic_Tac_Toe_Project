# Tic_Tac_Toe_Project
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with two players using a 3x3 board and placing 'X' or 'O' to create a straight line. In C, it employs a 2D array and routines for move, display, and win, to check valid moves. The ability to include features such as AI, undo, or graphics enhances the gameplay experience, and is an excellent programming project.

Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless two-player strategy board game for a 3x3 grid. The game is to have one player place three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a line, column, or diagonal first before the opponent. The game can be coded effectively in C using basic programming principles like arrays, loops, and conditional statements.

Game Structure & Features
Grid Representation

The game board is a 3x3 grid represented as a 2D array of characters.
A cell can contain either 'X', 'O', or be empty (' ').
Player Input & Turn Handling

Two players alternate entering their preferred positions (1-9).
The program prevents players from overwriting taken spaces.
An invalid move makes the user re-enter a valid position.
Win Conditions & Game Logic

The game checks for a win after every move.
A player is a winner if any row, column, or diagonal has the same symbol.
If there is no winner when all positions are occupied, the game is a draw.
Code Implementation Techniques

Employ functions for modular programming:
displayBoard() → Prints the current game board.
playerMove() → Gets input and modifies the board.
checkWin() → Returns the winner or a draw.
Places a loop to facilitate continuous play until a result is obtained.

Features to Make the Game Unique

AI Opponent Mode: Rather than two-player mode, apply a basic AI with random moves or the minimax algorithm to play strategically.
Custom Board Size: Adjust the grid to facilitate 4x4 or 5x5 gameplay for an added challenge.
Undo Feature: Save moves to an array to enable players to undo their last move.
Graphical Interface: Employ ASCII art or include graphics with the C graphics library (e.g., graphics.h in Turbo C++).
Conclusion
Implementing Tic-Tac-Toe in C is a great exercise in arrays, functions, and conditional logic. By adding distinctive features such as an AI opponent or an undo feature, you can develop an enhanced and interactive version of the game.
